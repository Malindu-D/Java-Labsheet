//     1.1
// there is no difference in an interface declare variable with public ,statics or final.
//we can't change the variables values if its in interface.

//      1.2
//all the methods in interfaces are abstract so use abstract keyword make no difference.

//      1.3
//can't change any changes inside the interface so, we can only implement and call those methods and declare instruction there.
